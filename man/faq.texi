@chapter Frequently Asked Questions

@enumerate

@item How do I bind a key to execute a shell command?

This isn't yet possible through the configuration tool. However these
bindings can be defined in your @file{~/.sawmillrc} file. For example:

@lisp
(bind-keys global-keymap
  "C-M-ESC" '(system "xterm &"))
@end lisp

@noindent
binds the event @kbd{C-M-ESC} to the Lisp code to start an @code{xterm}
subprocess


@item How do I get a grid of desktops?

This isn't completely possibly at the moment. But you can closely
approximate an @var{n}-by-@var{m} grid by doing the following:

@enumerate
@item Turn off the @samp{delete workspaces when empty} option

@item Set the minimum number of workspaces to @var{n} times @var{m}

@item Set the @code{workspace-columns} variable to @var{n}

@item Use the @code{next-workspace-row} and
@code{previous-workspace-row} commands to move up and down (bound to
@kbd{C-Down} and @kbd{C-Up} by default)

@item If you're using the GNOME pager, then you should set the
@samp{Rows of pagers} option to @var{m}
@end enumerate


@item How do I redefine the @samp{Applications} menu?

See the @samp{Popup Menus} node in the Info manual (@pxref{Popup
Menus})


@item I just created my @file{.sawmillrc} file, now the GNOME support
is broken?

You need the line @samp{(require 'gnome)} in your @file{.sawmillrc}


@item How do I create a new theme?

See the @samp{Window Frames} node of the Info manual (@pxref{Window
Frames})

Basically though, create a directory @file{~/.sawmill/themes/@var{foo}}
where @var{foo} is the name of your theme. Then copy any images into
this directory and create a file @file{theme.jl} that will be loaded to
initialise the theme

The configuration tool will display the contents of a file called
@file{README} in the directory (but make it 80-column text, and only a
few lines)


@item How do I port an Enlightenment theme to sawmill?

There's no automatic translation available. Get the images used in the
window border, then write a @file{theme.jl} file telling the window
manager how they are used to form a window frame

See the @file{themes/brushed-metal} directory for an example, and the
Info manual for the documentation


@item Are there any other themes available?

Not that I know of. If you have a theme that you think other people may
find useful, send it to me (or a URL), and I'll put a link from my web
page


@item Why don't you use GUILE?

Mainly because I'm lazy; I had already written rep, and therefore
understood it completely, whereas I have never used GUILE. Also, rep
has some features not available in GUILE (byte-code compilation,
autoloading, built-in event-loop, @dots{})

But before you flame me: yes I do think scheme is a more elegant
language


@item Will you add feature @var{x}?

Possibly. But only if it can be written in Lisp, or doesn't conflict
with the overall design aims.

These aims are to build a lightweight, generally applicable, set of
core window management functions, then write @emph{all} high-level
functionality as Lisp extensions


@item Is there a sawmill mailing list?

Yes, thanks to Erik Arneson @email{erik@@starseed.com} who manages it.

To subscribe, send a message to @email{majordomo@@aarg.net} with
@samp{subscribe sawmill} in the body.

The list is archived at @url{http://inanna.starseed.com/sawmill}.
