@chapter Frequently Asked Questions

@enumerate

@item How do I add customizations?

There are several files controlling this:

@table @file
@item ~/.sawmillrc
Hand written lisp code, loaded at startup. This is where almost all
explicit customization should be done.

@item sawmill-defaults
This lisp library is only loaded if there's no @file{.sawmillrc} file.

@item ~/.sawmill/custom
This stores customizations created by the configuration tool; it
shouldn't really be edited manually.

This file is loaded @emph{after} @file{sawmill-defaults}, but @emph{before}
@file{.sawmillrc}.
@end table


@item What's this @code{sawmill-client} program?

This allows you to connect to a window manager process and evaluate
arbitrary Lisp forms. Do @samp{sawmill-client -?} for more details
(@samp{sawmill-client -} for a read-eval-print loop)

By default you can only connect from the host running the wm (through a
unix-domain socket). To enable the network based server, evaluate the
lisp form @code{(server-net-init)}.

Note however that this connects through the X server, meaning that
anyone who can open windows on your display can also execute any Lisp
code on the host running the window manager (and by extension,
@emph{execute any program}).

So @emph{don't} run the net server with X access control disabled
(unless you're not connected to a network)


@item How do I bind a key to execute a shell command?

This isn't yet possible through the configuration tool. However these
bindings can be defined in your @file{~/.sawmillrc} file. For example:

@lisp
(bind-keys global-keymap
  "C-M-ESC" '(system "xterm &"))
@end lisp

@noindent
binds the event @kbd{C-M-ESC} to the Lisp code to start an @code{xterm}
subprocess


@item How do I redefine the @samp{Applications} menu?

See the @samp{Popup Menus} node in the Info manual (@pxref{Popup
Menus})


@item How do I read the Info manual?

Either execute the command @samp{info sawmill}, or enter the Info mode
within Emacs (@kbd{C-h i}) and type @kbd{g (sawmill) RET}.


@item How do I create a new theme?

See the @samp{Window Frames} node of the Info manual (@pxref{Window
Frames})

Basically though, create a directory @file{~/.sawmill/themes/@var{foo}}
where @var{foo} is the name of your theme. Then copy any images into
this directory and create a file @file{theme.jl} that will be loaded to
initialise the theme

The configuration tool will display the contents of a file called
@file{README} in the directory (but make it 80-column text, and only a
few lines)


@item How do I port an Enlightenment theme to sawmill?

There's no automatic translation available. Get the images used in the
window border, then write a @file{theme.jl} file telling the window
manager how they are used to form a window frame

See the @file{themes/brushed-metal} directory for an example, and the
Info manual for the documentation


@item Are there any other themes available?

There's a list including those I'm aware of on the sawmill home-page
(@url{http://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/~john/sw/sawmill/}).


@item Why don't GTK themes work with sawmill?

There was a problem with older versions of the @code{gtk-engines}
package preventing engine based themes working with several interpreted
languages. Get the latest @code{gtk-engines} from
@url{ftp://ftp.gnome.org/}


@item Why don't you use GUILE?

Mainly because I'm lazy; I had already written rep, and therefore
understood it completely, whereas I have never used GUILE. Also, rep
has some features not available in GUILE (byte-code compilation,
autoloading, built-in event-loop, @dots{})

But before you flame me: yes I do think scheme is a more elegant
language


@item Will you add feature @var{x}?

Possibly. But only if it can be written in Lisp, or doesn't conflict
with the overall design aims.

These aims are to build a lightweight, generally applicable, set of
core window management functions, then write @emph{all} high-level
functionality as Lisp extensions


@item Is there a sawmill mailing list?

Yes, thanks to Erik Arneson @email{erik@@starseed.com} who manages it.

To subscribe, send a message to @email{majordomo@@aarg.net} with
@samp{subscribe sawmill} in the body.

The list is archived at @url{http://inanna.starseed.com/sawmill}.
