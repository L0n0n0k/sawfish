@heading 1 Basic Introduction

@heading 1.0 What is that "X"?

@itemize @bullet

@item X, also called X11, is a protocoll defining the XServer and all related stuff. 

@item There are currently two major implementations XFree86 and X.Org, the later is a fork of the former.

@item Currently R7 (X11R7) is the most recent definition. R6 (X11R6) is also still used and available.

@item XFree86 and X.Org < 7.0 are X11R6, X.Org >= 7.0 is X11R7.

@item Major changes between R6 and R7 are the introduction of a modular X11, XDamage and XComposite (sawfish does currently not make use of that new stuff)

@item The XServer is an applications that creates an graphical display in opposite to the linux-console (also known as "Textmode"). Which is then used to display graphical applications.
