@heading User Documentation for Sawfish 1.5.0

@heading 1 Basic Introduction

@heading 1.0 What is that "X"?

@itemize @bullet

@item X, also called X11, is a protocol defining the XServer and all related stuff. 

@item There are currently two major implementations XFree86 and X.Org, the later is a fork of the former.

@item Currently R7 (X11R7) is the most recent definition. R6 (X11R6) is also still used and available.

@item XFree86 and X.Org < 7.0 are X11R6, X.Org >= 7.0 is X11R7.

@item Major changes between R6 and R7 are the introduction of a modular X11, XDamage and XComposite (sawfish does currently not make use of that new stuff)

@item The XServer is an applications that creates an graphical display in opposite to the linux-console (also known as "Textmode"). Which is then used to display graphical applications.

@heading 1.1 What is a Window Manager?

@itemize @bullet

@item Sawfish is a Window Manager, but what is that?

@item A Window Manager is an application that takes care of your windows, X-Events and more.

@item Some Window Managers include a Compositing Manager.
@end itemize

@heading 1.2 What is a Compositing Manager?

@itemize @bullet

@item A Compositing Manager is a plugin for a Window Manager (if built-in it's an Compositing Window Manager), that let's it create fancy graphical 3d effects, using XDamage and XComposite.

@item Sawfish does not ship a Compositing Manager yet. This is planned for version 3.0, if you want/need 3d effects, have a closer look at projects like the cairo-compositing-manager. (http://cairo-compmgr.tuxfamily.org/)

@heading 1.3 Why Sawfish?

@itemize @bullet

@item Well, sawfish is a very fast and extensible window-manager.

@item Powerfull key-bindings: Virtually every function can be bound to keys or mouse-buttons

@item Event Hooking: For many events (moving, edge-flipping ...) you can alter the way sawfish behaves

@item Window Matching: For each window you may set a set of actions to automatically perform. (different size, start-state ...)

@item Flexible Theming: Sawfish allows very different themes to be created and a variety is already available (http://sawfish.wikia.com/wiki/Themes)

@item Extensibility: Sawfish can load 3rdparty scripts easily and a whole bunch is just waiting to be discovered by you. (http://sawfish.wikia.com/wiki/Scripts)

@heading 3 Organizing Windows

Sawfish offers multiple means to organize windows, most can work at
the same time than others, as you need.


@heading 3.1 Workspaces

@itemize @bullet

@item Workspaces are virtual surfaces where to place windows. They are
also called (Virtual) Desktops in other WMs. You must have at least
one.

@item Windows can be in one or more workspaces at the same time, with
different positions in each.

@c navigate, add, merge, naming, etc

@end itemize


@heading 3.2 Viewports

@itemize @bullet

@item Workspaces can be bigger than your monitor, here is where the
concept of Viewport comes into play, it gives you a view into this bigger
space. All Workspaces must share the same size, though, like if they
were cut all at once.

@item You can move the Viewport around, and you will see how windows that
go out of the right side of the screen will appear from the left, if
you moved your viewport to the right. It is a continous surface. The
scrolling can be in full monitor increments or partial.

@c navigate, configure, etc

@end itemize

@heading 3.3 Layers

@itemize @bullet

@item Sometimes you want to keep some windows above all other windows. Or
maybe below them. Sawfish does this by means of Layers. A window in a
layer will always appear in a given depth, above lower valued layers, but
below.

@item Default level is 0, windows below are in negative levels, and windows
above are in positive levels. Many WMs support just three layers, Sawfish
by default assigns them the numbers -2, 0 and 2.

@c change, configure matchers, etc

@end itemize

@heading 3.4 Tabs

@c to be written once that settles
