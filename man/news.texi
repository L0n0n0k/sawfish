This lists the user-visible changes made to Sawmill, and which releases
they occurred between. For more detailed information see the
@file{ChangeLog} files in the Sawmill source tree.

@unnumberedsec 0.27

@itemize @bullet

@item Changed the name from @samp{sawmill} to @samp{sawfish}; all
user-visible binaries have been renamed appropriately, the old programs
will still work for now@dots{}

a new rep-gtk package) (Richard Kilgore). Added accelerators to many of
the standard menu items

@item Added some (untested) support for Xinerama: @code{current-head},
@code{current-head-dimensions}, @code{current-head-offset}. Some
placement modes should handle multiple heads sensibly, as should window
maximization and edge snapping.

preserve the stacking of the group, then change the selected window.
Added new command @code{raise-lower-group}

@item New option @code{raise-groups-on-focus}

@unnumberedsec 0.25.1

@itemize @bullet

@item Only force windows onto the visible screen if they didn't
explicitly set their position

@end itemize


@unnumberedsec 0.25

@itemize @bullet

@item New plugin @code{x}, a basic Xlib binding for creating and
drawing in windows (Merlin, me)

completion. Provision for completing functions, variables, commands,
files, directories, etc@dots{}. Also supports reading passwords. (Topi
Paavola, me)

@item Re-enabled the following interactive codes: @samp{a} (function),
@samp{C} (command), @samp{D} (directory), @samp{f} (existing file),

or number), @samp{s} (string), @samp{S} (symbol), @samp{v} (variable)

@item Support prefix keys in bindings (binding an event to a keymap, or
the name of a keymap, marks that event as a prefix key for the
associated keymap)

@item New command @code{call-command-with-output-to-screen}, prompts
for and invokes a command, then displays any output it emitted (bound
to @kbd{A-x} in default keymaps)

@item New variable @code{multi-click-delay}, maximum time in
milliseconds between button presses to count as @kbd{click2} or
@kbd{click3} events (Martin Blais)

@item New option @code{edge-flip-only-when-moving} (Yaron M. Minsky)

@item New window cycling commands @code{cycle-prefix},
@code{cycle-class} (Kai Großjohann); can now be bound to events with
more than one modifier (Timo Korvola)

GNOME control center. Add the sawmill capplet desktop entries to the
GNOME programs menu (under Settings). Also, beautify the names
displayed in the bindings widget

@item When applicable, load the GNOME applications menu when the wm is
first idle, reduces the latency of displaying the first root menu

@item Translation updates: de (Hubert Nachbaur), es (Iñaki García
Etxebarria), ja (Sato Satoru), sv (Andreas Persenius)

focused window is unmapped

@end itemize


@unnumberedsec 0.24

@itemize @bullet

@item Configure requests events are now passed to the hook
@code{configure-request-hook}. The new configure handler respects
window gravity when resizing

@item New option @code{configure-auto-gravity}. When enabled the window
gravity is implied by the position of the center of the window. (e.g.
try placing the GNOME control center in the bottom right corner of the
screen, then click on an item that causes it to resize)

@item Worked around the numerous reports of non-existent font errors
that using @code{XCreateFontSet} causes---fall back to
@code{XLoadQueryFont} if possible

@item There's now a library @file{custom-defaults} giving default
customization options (only if the user has no
@file{~/.sawmill/custom})

Also, remove the need to call @code{custom-add-required} in
@file{.sawmillrc}, it's always done now

@code{gravity} (overrides the hinted gravity value)

@item New placement modes @code{under-pointer} and
@code{centered-on-parent}

are now aligned into columns (if you use a monospaced font for them)

@item Variables @code{default-cursor},
@code{synthetic-configure-mutex}, @code{frame-draw-mutex},
@code{frame-state-mutex} are now functions

@item New functions @code{x-keysym-name}, @code{x-lookup-keysym},

Gillot), gl (Jesus Bravo Alvarez), nl (Han-Wen Nienhuys), pt_PT (Rui
Silva), sv (Andreas Persenius)

@item Fixed single-quoting in client readline (Matt Krai), copied
bouncing parentheses hack

@item Removed @code{fp->win == 0} assertion, it should be harmless and
was triggering for some people

@item Fixed bug of sending configure notify events to too many windows

@item Fixed off-by-one error in @code{ws-insert-workspace} (Kirk
Saranathan)

@item Customization groups are now organized as a tree structure, with
groups able to contain subgroups

@item Define the list of features that will be presented to the user in
@file{sawmill-defaults.jl}, by calling @code{custom-add-required}. If
you have a @file{.sawmillrc} you'll need to do this manually

@item New function @code{move-resize-window-to} doing a combined
move/resize. New variable @code{synthetic-configure-mutex}, when set
holds off sending synthetic @code{ConfigureNotify} events to windows
until it's unset (this is held while interactively moving or resizing
windows)

@item New hook @code{after-add-window-hook}. Called with a single
parameter, the window that's has just been adopted

@item New functions @code{x-kill-client}, @code{delete-window-safely}.
@code{send-client-message} now groks long integers (i.e. cons cells) in
32-bit data (Timo Korvola)

@item @code{window-put}, @code{window-get}, @code{image-put},
@code{image-get}, @code{font-put}, @code{font-get}: use @code{equal} to
compare keys, not @code{eq}

@item New module @code{error-handler}, implements a simple alternative
error handler (and allows the much-maligned beep to be turned off),
requires rep 0.11+

@item Allow the pointer-warp position to be defined relative to the

manager that the theme is editable. The wm adds an @samp{Edit Theme...}
option to the Customize menu when appropriate

@item The @code{call-after-property-changed} function can now be given
a list of properties to monitor (James Antill)

@item New function @code{call-after-state-changed}, monitors a list of
window states (i.e. things like iconified, shaded, @dots{}) and calls a
function when any of them change. The @code{window-state-change-hook}
now has a second argument (apart from the window), the list of symbolic
states that changed (James Antill)

@item Add support for @code{skip-winlist} and @code{skip-tasklist} to

@item Fixed the ``uniconify to current workspace'' option

@item Added window-maximization predicates to the gaol

@end itemize


@unnumberedsec 0.20

@itemize @bullet

@item Rewrote workspace handling---windows can now appear on multiple
workspaces, with each instance having different properties (position,
size, whatever@dots{}) 

Create new window instances by using the @code{copy-to-next-workspace},
@code{copy-to-previous-workspace}, and @code{copy-to-workspace:@var{n}}
commands. Merge instances by moving them to the same workspace, or
using the @code{delete-window-instance} command

workspace areas by one-dimensional values (adapted from code by Eric
Kidd)

@item Rewrote tooltips; especially how they're removed (also, don't

@unnumberedsec 0.18

@itemize @bullet

@item General subsystem for matching windows to properties as they're
created. Allows matching on one or more of the window's X properties
(e.g. name, class, etc@dots{}), and then setting any number of window
manager properties as a result. See the @samp{Matched Windows}
customize group

@item Removed all @code{auto-@var{foo}-alist} and
@code{@var{bar}-windows-re} variables, they're obsoleted by the general
match-windows mechanism

@item Respect window's size hints when maximizing (both to see if the
window is maximizable, and to truncate the maximized dimensions to an
integral number of rows and columns)

@item Show actual colors in the configurator, not just their names

@item Added a new directory to the theme search path:
@file{@var{prefix}/share/sawmill/themes}. Use this for system-wide
themes (don't use the version specific directory)

@item Deprecated the @code{show-message} function, replaced by
@code{display-message} with a better calling interface; also displays
multi-line strings

should be more ICCCM-compliant

@item Fixed typos in one-dimensional maximisation (Gérard Milmeister)

@item Fixed the logic deciding when it's necessary to switch workspaces
after merging an empty one

@item Fixed interactive placement showing the window when edge-flipping
(but it still doesn't work properly, rubber band traces are left)

@item Removed flicker when focusing already-focused windows

@end itemize


@unnumberedsec 0.17

@itemize @bullet

@item First version to use lexically scoped librep. This enables themes
to run in a ``safe'' environment, but all existing themes will need to
be ported; other language changes include the use of a single symbol
namespace, and scheme-like function call semantics

@item Support for internationalization of messages and run-time
documentation; an en_GB catalogue is the only translation currently, so
please send me .po files for your native languages!

New option @samp{--disable-nls} to disable i18n

@item New functions @code{call-after-property-changed} and
@code{gtkrc-call-after-changed} to allow themes to receive these events
(hooks are now off-limits to themes)

@item New command @code{raise-window-and-pass-through-click}; bind it
to a mouse button in the @code{window-keymap} to get the ``raise window
on click'' behaviour that seems popular 

@item New commands to move windows incrementally:
@code{slide-window-@var{x}} and @code{slide-group-@var{x}} for @var{x}
one of: @code{left}, @code{right}, @code{up}, @code{down}

@item Rewrote obscure documentation for some custom options

@item Fixed bug when grabbing events with @code{AnyModifier} and a
specific button

@end itemize


@unnumberedsec 0.16

@itemize @bullet

@item Support window groups, both as defined by applications, and
defined by the user (either interactively through the window's menu, or
via the @code{auto-group-alist} and @code{persistent-group-ids}
variables).

For most commands working on single windows, there's also one operating
on the group that the current window is a member of. (With the notable
exception currently of moving windows.) There's also options
controlling whether (de)iconification operates on windows or groups

@item Improved GNOME menu support---merge duplicate sub-menus, scan
PATH for @code{gnome-share-directory}, also look in
@file{/etc/X11/applnk} for menu entries

@item Fix problem of window losing focus when @code{cycle-windows} only
finds a single window; also, abort immediately if there's no windows to
cycle through at all

@unnumberedsec 0.14

@itemize @bullet

@item Rewrote window-maximization, many new options

color)

@item Fix image tiling in frame part backgrounds

skipping ignored windows)

@item Fix some problems with viewports when exiting/restarting

@item Fix broken stacking of windows after they're mapped

@item Prevent smart window placement blowing up when large numbers of

event queue is too large, as well as trying to prune the search space)

@end itemize


@unnumberedsec 0.12

@itemize @bullet

@item Remember most recently focused windows on each workspace,
activate that window after changing workspaces; also, try to preserve
focus when moving windows between workspaces

@item Option to disable auto-raise while cycling through windows
(@code{cycle-disable-auto-raise}); option to restrict cycling to the
current viewport (@code{cycle-all-viewports})

@item Option @code{lock-first-workspace} is now enabled by default, and

@email{goller@@eng.utah.edu})

@item Added shaped-transient frame to microGUI theme

@unnumberedsec 0.11

@itemize @bullet

@item New option @code{lock-first-workspace}, prevent the first
workspace from being deleted when it's empty

@item New option @code{ignore-window-input-hint}, to always give
windows the focus, whether they say they will accept it or not

@item New options when cycling windows: @code{cycle-warp-pointer} and
@code{cycle-focus-windows}

@item Restore the old method of setting the focus, should fix bug of
losing focus totally when switching to a new workspace

@end itemize


@unnumberedsec 0.10

@itemize @bullet

@item Implemented virtual workspaces, bind to the
@code{move-viewport-@var{x}} and @code{move-window-@var{x}} commands
(for @var{x} being @code{left}, @code{right}, @code{up}, or
@code{down})

@item Added a new theme: @code{microGUI} by Ryan Lovett
@email{ryan@@ocf.berkeley.edu}, based on the QNX Photon screenshots

@item Added a @samp{Grab key} button in the bindings widget, replaces
the current binding with the next pressed key

@item Lisp module to load the GNOME menus and use them to replace the
applications menu. Add @code{(require 'gnome-menu)} to your
@file{~/.sawmillrc} file to load it

@item Network server is disabled by default (since it can provide a
security hole if X access control is disabled); re-enabled the old unix
domain socket code (see the FAQ for more details)

@item Only give the input focus to windows that actually want it

@item New option to keep transient windows above their parents
(@code{transients-above-parents})

@item New option to control how the workspace boundary is handled when
moving windows between workspaces (@code{workspace-send-boundary-mode})

@item New commands @code{send-to-workspace:@var{x}} for @var{x} from 1
to 9

@item While windows are hidden or shaded, unmap the client (for ICCCM
compliance)

@item Slightly different method of handling destroyed clients,
hopefully results in fewer annoying error messages

@item Now handles client windows being reparented by a third party
(i.e. swallowing apps)

@end itemize


@unnumberedsec 0.9

@itemize @bullet

@item The first-fit and best-fit algorithms are now much more
intelligent, e.g. instead of falling back to random placement when a
window can't be placed without overlapping an existing window, they
will attempt to minimize this degree of overlapping

@item The @code{foreground} property of each frame part may now be an
image instead of a piece of text

@item New theme @code{smaker}, uses the foreground images capability to
do a somewhat WindowMaker-like theme (with the absolute-e images). This
theme is extensively customizable---all images, colors, dimensions,
etc@dots{}

@item Use Imlib's fuzzy color matching for all color allocation; this
should help on @code{PseudoColor} visuals

@item Added an @code{xterm} command to launch an xterm

@item Improved the bindings customization widget layout; added a
@samp{Copy} button to insert a copy of the current binding

@item Added @code{next-workspace-row} and @code{previous-workspace-row}
commands. Together with the @code{workspace-columns} variable these
mimic a 2d desktop

@item Removed the @code{cycle-through-workspaces} option, there's now
@code{workspace-boundary-mode}---one of @code{stop}, @code{wrap-around}
or @code{keep-going}

@item Added option to include ignored windows when edge snapping
(@code{move-snap-ignored-windows})

@item Fix race condition between startup of sawmill and gmc; sawmill

@item Fix bug associated with WordPerfect's menu window

@end itemize


@unnumberedsec 0.8

@itemize @bullet

@item First attempt at best-fit window placement (doesn't really work
properly yet@dots{})

@item Added a customization option to focus windows when they're
un-iconified (@code{focus-windows-on-uniconify})

@item Fix bug in click-to-focus mode where the click is only passed
through to the client window, not to any local bindings of the wm

@item Don't leave windows unframed if there's an error in the user's
startup files

@item Fix bug in @code{preallocated-workspaces} option

@item Don't place windows off-screen in first-fit mode

@end itemize


@unnumberedsec 0.7

@itemize @bullet

@item Added stack-based window cycling, bound to @kbd{M-TAB} by
default. Hold @key{Meta}, keep pressing @key{TAB} until the correct
window is reached, then let go of @key{Meta}.

@item Added first-fit window placement (a.k.a smart-placement)

@item Completed first stage of workspace rewrite---shouldn't go
ballistic when windows are removed anymore

@item Added @code{override-frame-part-classes} variable---allows all
frame properties to be overridden on a per-class basis

@item Click-to-focus now accepts any button and any modifiers

@item Don't snap to gmc icons or panels

@item Added an @code{auto-window-type-alist} variable mapping window
names to border types

@item New variables @code{eval-modifier-events} and
@code{eval-key-release-events} to allow catching these types of
keyboard events, disabled by default

@item Added functions for actively grabbing the keyboard

@item Removed the long names of the keyboard modifiers, only the single
character modifiers are left

@item If no alt modifier, set it to the same as meta; new variables
@code{alt-keysyms} and @code{meta-keysyms} describe the virtual
modifier assignments

@item Fix bug when handling shaped frame parts---it was possible to go
into a long enter-, leave-notify loop when the old shape was cleared

@item Fix bug where opaque resizing with snap-to-edges on moved the
window as well as resizing it

@item Fix bug when raising the only managed window

@item Fix bug where very small client windows got weirdly shaped
frames

@end itemize


@unnumberedsec 0.6

@itemize @bullet

@item Define the standard @dfn{classes} of frame parts (i.e. things
like close button, title, left border, etc...) then allow the state of
members of these classes to be set in one place (the
@code{frame-part-classes} variable). This should ensure that different
themes have the same feel (but a feel that may be customized by the
user)

@item Allow frame parts to be removed if possible (if they have the
@code{removable} property). Nothing makes use of this yet

@item Added window-shading, double-click button1 on the title bar

@item Created a sawmill capplet for the GNOME control center. Use the
@samp{--enable-capplet} configure option to build it

@item First attempt at a technical manual (very quickly written, so
probably some inaccuracies)

@item In the @code{gtk} theme, draw bevels on window decorations

@item Use spin-buttons in the configurator to enter numbers

@item Add option @code{focus-proxy-click} controlling whether to pass
the focus-inducing button-press event to the underlying window (in
click-to-focus mode)

@item Changed the bindings in window borders, it's now the more usual
button1 to resize, button2 to move

@item When clicking and dragging windows, ensure that the clicked frame
part stays clicked until the button is released

@item If in click-to-focus mode, and there's no parent window to focus
when the focused window is closed, focus the topmost window (not the
window under the pointer as in the other focus modes)

@item Changing window frames is @emph{much} less ugly, no flicker at
all!

@item Try to optimise window restacking some more

@item Sped up opaque window moving when the position display is enabled

@item Preserve iconified state across restarts

@item Optimise updating the shape of an unframed window (this stops gmc
icons flashing annoyingly)

@item Fix bugs in click-to-focus mode where some windows were
un-focusable

@item Fix bug where cycling through windows in click-to-focus mode
didn't focus the activated window

@item Fix bug where comparing sawmill lisp objects caused a crash

@item Fix bug where initiating a resize in the middle of the window
didn't allow any of the edges to be moved

@item Fix bug where changing the ``decorate transients'' option didn't
alter any existing transient windows

@item Fix bug where iconifying a sticky or ignored window gave no way
of reclaiming it---these windows now appear at the end of the window
menu

@end itemize


@unnumberedsec 0.5

@itemize @bullet

@item Now does session management. The scheme is extensible, arbitrary
Lisp modules can save and restore window state due to their own
functionality (using the @code{sm-window-save-functions} and
@code{sm-restore-window-hook} hooks). See @file{lisp/workspace.jl} for
an example

@item Displays window position or dimensions whilst interactively
moving or resizing a window (@code{move-show-position},
@code{resize-show-dimensions})

@item Mechanism for setting frame styles on a per-window basis (this
was always possible, just not easy). The @code{auto-frame-style-alist}
variable associates window name regular expressions with frame styles.
Also, the @code{window-ops-menu} has a new submenu with all possible
styles

@item New option @code{preallocated-workspaces}, the number of
workspaces to create at startup

@item Window-workspace mapping is preserved through restart (as long as
the GNOME hints are enabled)

@item Theme directories may contain a short @file{README} file that
will be displayed in the configuration tool

@item Changed the custom file to @file{~/.sawmill/custom} instead of
@file{~/.sawmill-custom}. The old file will be moved to the new
location if it exists

@item Install @file{sawmill-menu} under @file{libexec} since it
shouldn't be run manually

@item Option in @code{gradient} theme to create full-sized gradient
images, trading memory for quality

@item Workaround the flicker when raising windows

@item Changed most of the @code{menus} and @code{custom} customize
options into normal variables (they're not particularly intuitive)

@end itemize


@unnumberedsec 0.4

@itemize @bullet

@item Frame parts can now be highlighted when the mouse is over them,
also they ``un-click'' and ``re-click'' as the pointer leaves and
re-enters their window. ButtonRelease bindings are only activated when
the mouse is in the window at the time

@item Frame part backgrounds can now be rendered on-the-fly using the
new @code{renderer} property in frame definitions. This property is a
function called with args @code{(@var{image} @var{state})}; it should
draw a background into @var{image} for the specified state (@code{nil},
@code{focused}, @code{highlighted} or @code{clicked})

@item New theme @code{gtk}. This reads the default GTK style and uses
the associated colors and pixmaps to decorate windows. It doesn't try
to handle engine-based themes. It should automatically detect when the
default style changes (if changed by the GNOME control center). Do
@samp{sawmill-client -c gtk-reload-style} in the shell to reload the
style manually

@item Functions for drawing color gradients and bevels into images. The
new @code{gradient} theme uses these and on-the-fly rendering to do
@code{afterstep}-like window titles

@item Configurator changes: use a paned widget to separate the list of
groups from the settings (stops their relative sizes changing), allow
each group to be customized separately, either through a new set of
root-submenus or the commands @code{customize:@var{group}} for each
@var{group}.

@item Changed the way that ``themes'' are organised, each theme now
gets its own directory, which must include a @file{theme.jl} or
@file{theme.jlc} script to initialise a frame-style of the same name as
the directory. While this script is being evaluated the image path is
set so that the theme can load any images stored in its directory.

Also created the variable @code{theme-load-path} containing the list of
directories searched when trying to load a theme. By default it
contains two directories: @file{~/.sawmill/themes/} and
@file{@var{prefix}/share/sawmill/@var{version}/themes}.

@item Resizing now chooses the direction to resize the window in by the
initial position of the pointer in relation to the window. The window
is divided into a 3x3 grid, the pointer must be in one of the outer
rectangles to resize in that direction

@item New commands @code{select-workspace:@var{X}} for @var{X} between
1 and 9

@item Support multiple depths, or layers, of windows

@item It's now possible to move the current workspace up or down the
list of all workspaces

@item New option @samp{-c COMMAND} to @code{sawmill-client}; invokes
the named interactive function

@item When an app asks for no title and no border, give it what it
wants---use the new @code{unframed} window type

@item The maximize button works

@item Option to control placement of transient windows
(@code{place-transient-mode})

@item Changing the frame style preserves the original window stacking
order

@item Added documentation strings for most built-in functions

@item Fix bug of evaluating both KeyPress @emph{and} KeyRelease events

@item Fix bug of making the shape mask of unshaped client windows too
big

@item Fix bug where already-handled BadWindow errors were being reported

@item Fix bug where the @code{window-ops-menu} could be displayed from
one window but then affect a different window

@item Fix bug where click-to-focus doesn't work for new windows

@item Fix bug where deleting the last workspace selected the first, not
the new last workspace

@item Fix bug where changing a colormap when no window is focused
causes a segfault

@item Fix bug where iconifying a window may leave it in the clicked
state after it's uniconified

@item Fix Caps_Lock and Num_Lock modifiers interfering with bindings

@item Fix accessing X properties on 64-bit architectures

@item Fix bug where pointer may be left grabbed after moving a window

@item Where available, show documentation strings of commands in the
configurator

@item Improve the method of handling clicks in frame-parts

@item Fix asynchronous client-server protocol

@unnumberedsec 0.3

@itemize @bullet

@item Implemented window maximization

@item Added support for snapping to window edges when interactively
moving windows (@code{move-snap-edges} and @code{move-snap-epsilon})

@item First attempt at handling a subset of the Motif and OpenLook
window hints

@item Removed the @code{sloppy-focus} variable, it's replaced by
@code{focus-mode}. This can currently be one of @code{enter-exit}
(normal focus follows pointer), @code{enter-only} (``sloppy'' focus) or
@code{click} (click to focus)

@item When resolving pointer events, scan the @code{keymap} property of
the window under the pointer, not the focused window (as with keypress
events)

@item The @file{sawmill-client} program can now communicate inter-host,
since it uses X properties not raw sockets

@item New hook @code{before-exit-hook}, called immediately before
shutting down

@item Rewrote the GNOME support as a Lisp module

@item Placing windows interactively now works

@item Fixed the bug on Solaris where deleting windows could cause a
segmentation fault

@end itemize


@unnumberedsec 0.2

@itemize @bullet

@item Added a user-customization system, inspired by Emacs' customize
facility. Invoke this through the @samp{sawmill-ui} program, or from
the @samp{Customize...} entry in the main menu. All changes are stored
in the Lisp script @file{~/.sawmill-custom}

@item Selected windows may now be raised
(@code{raise-selected-windows})

@item It's possible to prevent the mouse pointer being warped to
selected windows (@code{warp-to-selected-windows})

@item The @code{brushed-metal} and @code{simple} themes now define all
four standard frame types

@item Frame themes are now stored in a separate directory
(@file{@var{prefix}/share/sawmill/@var{version}/lisp/themes}) so that
the list of all available themes can be made automatically

@item The frame colors of the @code{simple} frame style can now be
customized (@code{simple-normal-color} and @code{simple-active-color})

@item The @file{sawmill-defaults.jl} script enables GNOME compliance
unconditionally (since it has no ill-effects even if GNOME isn't being
used)

@item Transient windows can be given the same frames as normal windows
(@code{decorate-transients})

@item Newly-displayed transient windows can be automatically given the
focus if their parent window is focused (@code{transients-get-focus})

@item Any newly-displayed windows can be automatically given the input
focus (@code{focus-windows-when-mapped})

@item The @code{foreground}, @code{background} and @code{font}
attributes of each frame part may now refer to a function

@item Fixed the window-move bug whereby the first motion event was
discarded

@item Fixed the bug where windows may be placed partially off the root
window, even if they needn't be

@item Fixed the shaped frame parts bug (they didn't work)

@item Miscellaneous other bug-fixes
