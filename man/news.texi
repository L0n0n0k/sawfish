This lists the user-visible changes made to Sawmill, and which releases
they occurred between. For more detailed information see the
@file{ChangeLog} files in the Sawmill source tree.


@section 0.4

@itemize @bullet

@item Support multiple depths, or layers, of windows

@item It's now possible to move the current workspace up or down the
list of all workspaces

@item New option @samp{-c COMMAND} to @code{sawmill-client}; invokes
the named interactive function

@item Configurator changes: use a paned widget to separate the list of
groups from the settings (stops their relative sizes changing), allow
each group to be customized separately, either through a new set of
root-submenus or the commands @code{customize:@var{group}} for each
@var{group}.

@item When an app asks for no title and no border, give it what it
wants---use the new @code{unframed} window type

@item The maximize button works now

@item Fix bug of evaluating both KeyPress @emph{and} KeyRelease events

@item Fix bug of making the shape mask of unshaped client windows too
big

@item Fix bug where already-handled BadWindow errors were being reported

@end itemize


@section 0.3a

@itemize @bullet

@item Support the maximized GNOME window states

@item Where available, show documentation strings of commands in the
configurator

@item Improve the method of handling clicks in frame-parts

@item Fix asynchronous client-server protocol

@item Fix interactive window moving/resizing (don't leave traces of the
rubber-band, stop the window initially ``jumping'' to the pointer)

@end itemize


@section 0.3

@itemize @bullet

@item Implemented window maximization

@item Added support for snapping to window edges when interactively
moving windows (@code{move-snap-edges} and @code{move-snap-epsilon})

@item First attempt at handling a subset of the Motif and OpenLook
window hints

@item Removed the @code{sloppy-focus} variable, it's replaced by
@code{focus-mode}. This can currently be one of @code{enter-exit}
(normal focus follows pointer), @code{enter-only} (``sloppy'' focus) or
@code{click} (click to focus)

@item When resolving pointer events, scan the @code{keymap} property of
the window under the pointer, not the focused window (as with keypress
events)

@item The @file{sawmill-client} program can now communicate inter-host,
since it uses X properties not raw sockets

@item New hook @code{before-exit-hook}, called immediately before
shutting down

@item Rewrote the GNOME support as a Lisp module

@item Placing windows interactively now works

@item Fixed the bug on Solaris where deleting windows could cause a
segmentation fault

@end itemize


@section 0.2

@itemize @bullet

@item Added a user-customization system, inspired by Emacs' customize
facility. Invoke this through the @samp{sawmill-ui} program, or from
the @samp{Customize...} entry in the main menu. All changes are stored
in the Lisp script @file{~/.sawmill-custom}

@item Selected windows may now be raised
(@code{raise-selected-windows})

@item It's possible to prevent the mouse pointer being warped to
selected windows (@code{warp-to-selected-windows})

@item The @code{brushed-metal} and @code{simple} themes now define all
four standard frame types

@item Frame themes are now stored in a separate directory
(@file{@var{prefix}/share/sawmill/@var{version}/lisp/themes}) so that
the list of all available themes can be made automatically

@item The frame colors of the @code{simple} frame style can now be
customized (@code{simple-normal-color} and @code{simple-active-color})

@item The @file{sawmill-defaults.jl} script enables GNOME compliance
unconditionally (since it has no ill-effects even if GNOME isn't being
used)

@item Transient windows can be given the same frames as normal windows
(@code{decorate-transients})

@item Newly-displayed transient windows can be automatically given the
focus if their parent window is focused (@code{transients-get-focus})

@item Any newly-displayed windows can be automatically given the input
focus (@code{focus-windows-when-mapped})

@item The @code{foreground}, @code{background} and @code{font}
attributes of each frame part may now refer to a function

@item Fixed the window-move bug whereby the first motion event was
discarded

@item Fixed the bug where windows may be placed partially off the root
window, even if they needn't be

@item Fixed the shaped frame parts bug (they didn't work)

@item Miscellaneous other bug-fixes

@end itemize


@section 0.1

First proper release
