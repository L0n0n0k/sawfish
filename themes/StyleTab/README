StyleTab

Tab themes for sawfish. This theme combines flexibility, appealing
look'n'feel and innovative ideas. As of Sawfish 1.8.0 it's the default theme.

It combines 4 themes (Reduce, DarkTab, DarkColor & Smoothly), bundled
with support for tabbed windowing, provides various options for titlebar colors
or button-order (separately for toplevel windows and transients) aswell as
support for having the titlebar on any of the four sides (can be different for
each window, using the "title-position" window-matcher).

Ideas/code taken over from Crux/Anonymous/Mxflat/Reduce themes.
