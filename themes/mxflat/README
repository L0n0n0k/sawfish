mxflat (v0.7.4) sawfish theme

the mxflat theme was made to match the gtk[1|2]-flat-engine.
it is probably the most customizable sawfish theme out there
but it also works very well if you do not adjust anything.
remember: if there is something special to know about an option,
there is probably a tooltip helping you out.

please send us your button icon sets if you've made any!

### upgrading  ###

(0.7.2 or later)
nothing

(0.7.1 or earlier)
you should really open ~/.sawfish/custom and delete the line
containing "mxflat:button-position-model". besides the
button position direction was changes, so you have to change
all negative position values to positive ones in sawfish-config or the 
custom file. furthermore some config variable names have changes,
so it might happen you have to readjust some options.

### installation ###

copy the 'mxflat' directory that you have extracted from the mxflat-*.tar.gz
to you sawfish theme directory (~/.sawfish/themes or /usr/share/sawfish/themes).
check the file-permissions, then start "sawfish-config" and
choose "mxflat" as your default frame style.

hint: it is recommended to use "sawfish-config" and 
not the gnome control-center to configure this theme.

### copyright ###

mxflat was build with heavy use of other themes as reference
(e.g. the crux or gradient theme, just to name two of them)
and the help of the people in #sawfish at the freenode irc network.
besides we were inspired by the comments of people at our freshmeat page at

http://themes.freshmeat.net/projects/mxflat/
	
 thanks to all of them!
