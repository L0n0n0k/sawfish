 - Transient frames like those at the qnx site, maybe more.
 - Short window title bars like the GIMP's look funky, give it a transient
   frame?
 - Middle clicking title bar to drag, left clicking to resize is
   backwards, must fix.

 If someone wants to fix/add something, feel free to mail me
(ryan@ocf.berkeley.edu) and I'll incorporate the changes.
