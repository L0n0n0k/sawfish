This theme was based on the QNX Photon microGUI found at www.qnx.com
(screenshots at http://www.qnx.com/amiga/delivering.html).  Many image
components were taken from the minEguE enlightenment theme by Ben
FrantzDale (frantzdb@admin.arhs.net). The theme and the rest of the images
were put together by Ryan (ryan@ocf.berkeley.edu).
