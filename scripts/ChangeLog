	* sawfish-about.jl.in: 

	Open the necessary modules that aren't included in `rep'
	structure anymore (rep.regexp, rep.system, rep.io.streams,
	rep.io.files, rep.io.file-handlers)

2000-09-07  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* sawfish-menu.jl: added a `(group . ID)' option, radio-items
	are created such that all items with the same ID are in the
	same radio group

	* sawfish-menu.jl: menu items can now be dotted to an alist of
	options. Currently the only option is `(check . BOOL)'

2000-09-04  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* Makefile.in: make sawfish-about.jl depend on ./Makefile

	* sawfish-about.jl.in: hacked the `exec' line to work with
	solaris /bin/sh

2000-09-03  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* sawfish-client.jl: print a copyright banner when starting the
	repl

	* sawfish-client.jl (do-eval): remember to update current-repl
	after reading the new structure over the connection

	* sawfish-client.jl (rl-completion-generator): use
	repl-completions function to generate completions

2000-09-01  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* sawfish-about.jl.in: an `about' program for sawfish, uses the
	GnomeAbout dialog when possible (via sawfish.gtk.stock)

	* sawfish.png: logo for the about program, borrowed from
	http://iwc.org/volunteers/archives/Oct98/spec_pg0.htm
