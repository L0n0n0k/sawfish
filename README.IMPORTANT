In Sawfish 1.8.0 there are the following major changes:

grand edge refactoring
**********************

Location changes:
sawfish.wm.ext.edge-flip => sawfish.wm.edge.flip
sawfish.wm.ext.infinite-desktop => sawfish.wm.edge.infinite-desktop
sawfish.wm.util.flippers => sawfish.wm.edge.flippers

Be sure to update your sawfishrc accordingly! Besides the following
manual adjustments are required to make Sawfish 2.90.0 work properly:

- remove any reference to the old files from .sawfish/custom while SawfishConfig
  is not running (sawfish.wm.ext.edge-flip might appear in it!)

- if you use SawfishPager, update to version 0.90.1 before restarting Sawfish

------------------------------------------------------------------------
In Sawfish 1.6.0 there are the following major changes:

sawfish-ui is now sawfish-config
********************************

The sawfish-configuration-tool has been renamed from
`sawfish-ui' to `sawfish-config'

$prefix/libexecdir -> $prefix/lib directory move
************************************************

libreps/sawfishs library directory as changes as mentioned above,
thus you need to recompile anything linked against both, which
namely means rep-gtk and sawfish-pager, and everything will
work again as expected.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
In Sawfish 1.5.0 there are the following major changes:

sawmill-defaults is now sawfish-defaults
****************************************

sawfish-defaults is an alias to the standard sawfish
configuration, if your ~/.sawfish[/]rc contains the line:

(require 'sawmill-defaults)

then updated the line to the new value:

(require 'sawfish-defaults)

~/.sawmillrc is no longer a valid configuration file
****************************************************

now, there we fully renamed from sawmil to sawfish,
also ~/.sawmillrc is no longer a valid configuration file.

if you're using it, simply rename it to:

~/.sawfishrc -or- ~/.sawfish/rc

both are valid and please restart sawfish after renaming
your configuration file.

Building using XFree86 or X.Org 6.x instead of X.Org 7.x:
*********************************************************

simply add the following flag to configure:

--without-xorg-x11r7

(eg: ./configure --prefix=/usr --without-xorg-x11r7)

Building without using PANGO for font-rendering:
************************************************

simply add the following flag to configure:

--without-pango

(eg: ./configure --prefix=/usr --without-pango)

Building without translations:
******************************

simply add the following flag to configure:

--without-nls

(eg: ./configure --prefix=/usr --without-nls)

SawfishConfig GtkTree:
*******************

recently the old GtkNotebook UI has been replaced by a GtkTree
UI, sadly this widget does currently not support single-clicking
it, so you need to double-click it. 

but: the old ui is -of course- still available, use:

sawfish-config --flatten [in a terminal]
(defvar-setq customize-program "sawfish-config --flatten") [in your config-file]
