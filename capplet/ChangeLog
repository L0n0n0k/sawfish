	* sawmill-capplet.c (sawmill_running_p): new function, test if
	sawmill is actually running
	(sawmill_setup): if the wm isn't running, just print a message
	to this effect in the capplet widget

	* sawmill-capplet.c (main): disabled some of the session
	management stuff that was copied from mouse-properties.c; I
	don't understand it fully and it makes the
	GNOME_SAWMILL_PROPERTIES root property expand forever..

	* sawmill-capplet.c (sawmill_cancel): don't destroy the capplet
	widget
