	* sawmill-capplet.c: don't assume atomic I/O (pointed out by
	James Antill <james@and.org>)

2000-02-27  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* Makefile.in: install desktop entries under Settings/Sawmill
	in the apps menu as well as in the control center directory

2000-02-26  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* sawmill-capplet.c: replace --notebook option to sawmill-ui
	with --flatten

2000-02-24  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* sawmill-capplet.c: handle sawmill-ui failing to start
	correctly

1999-10-30  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* Makefile.in: don't need to pass -I option anymore

	* sawmill-capplet.c (sawmill_setup): close more file
	descriptors before exec'ing

	* sawmill-capplet.c: changed how some include files are named

1999-09-30  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* sawmill-capplet.c (sawmill_running_p): use libclient.o to
	check if the wm is running (due to the multiple connection
	methods)

1999-09-08  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* sawmill-capplet.c (sawmill_running_p): new function, test if
	sawmill is actually running
	(sawmill_setup): if the wm isn't running, just print a message
	to this effect in the capplet widget

	* sawmill-capplet.c (main): disabled some of the session
	management stuff that was copied from mouse-properties.c; I
	don't understand it fully and it makes the
	GNOME_SAWMILL_PROPERTIES root property expand forever..

	* sawmill-capplet.c (sawmill_cancel): don't destroy the capplet
	widget
