In Sawfish 1.5.0 there are the following major changes:

**********

- sawmill-defaults is now sawfish-defaults

This means if you got

(require 'sawmill-defaults) in your sawfishrc, replace it by
(require 'sawfish-defaults)

**********

- ~/.sawmillrc is no longer a valid configuration file, if
you still use it, rename it to either ~/.sawfishrc or ~/sawfish/rc

**********

- XFree86 is no longer detected by configure.in 
(XXX Will add work-around for XFree86 Users later on XXX)

**********
