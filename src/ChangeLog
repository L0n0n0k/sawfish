	* frames.c (list_frame_generator): when hide-client is set,
	ensure that the client window ends up unmapped

	* windows.c (focus_on_window): don't focus unmapped client
	windows, focus the frame instead (so its state changes)

	* sawmill.h (Lisp_Window): new bits: `client_hidden' and
	`client_unmapped'. Used to allow the client to be unmapped
	while its shaded. Added integers `local_maps' and
	`local_unmaps': the number of expected notify events

	* events.c (map_notify, unmap_notify): look at the local_maps
	and local_unmaps fields

	* windows.c (Fhide_window, Fshow_window): set the
	client_unmapped bit, and use local_[un]maps instead of the
	event mask

	* sawmill-ui.jl (build-keymap-shell): added a `Grab key' button

1999-09-30  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* main.c (exit_code): variable replacing the old jmp_buf exit
	method; set the variable to an exit code then call Fquit ()
	* session.c (die): use the new exit method

	* frames.c (set_frame_part_fg): remember to tell the event loop
	that there may be X events read but not handled (Imlib..)

	* libclient.c, libclient.h: abstracted the guts of client.c,
	providing a better interface
	* client.c: call the client_ functions in libclient.o

1999-09-29  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* client.c: added back the old unix domain code, if this can't
	make a connection, then try the X property based server
	* server.c, server.h: reprieved, enabled by default now, but
	write sockets as ~/.sawmill/.unix-CANONICAL-DISPLAY

	* display.c (Qcanonical_display_name): new variable, display
	name with fq hostname and screen number

	* functions.c (Fget_x_text_property, Fset_x_text_property): new

	properties, only refresh the frame or call the hook if the
	value of the property _actually changed_

	new functions, gets/sets the color of the transparent pixels

1999-09-28  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* keys.c (search_keymap): allow things like `Any-C-x' to work;
	this looks for a `C-x' event plus any other modifiers

	* session.c: if HAVE_X11_SM_SMLIB_H isn't defined, don't do any
	session management

	* windows.c (Fwindow_wants_input_p): new function, returns the
	input field of a window's WM_HINTS property

	* frames.c (set_frame_part_bg): when checking if the part
	overlaps the client, do it correctly

1999-09-27  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* windows.c (remove_window_frame): only remove windows from
	the save-set if the client window was unmapped by its owner

	* display.c (error_handler): ignore errors where resourceid is
	zero, and don't print unrecognized errors, they're just
	annoying..

	* sawmill.h (WINDOWP): now the same as XWINDOWP; i.e. we don't
	care whether or not the client has disappeared (which was
	causing more problems than it solved)

	* windows.c (Fhide_window, Fshow_window): unmap the client
	window when it's hidden (by law of the ICCCM)

	* frames.c (list_frame_generator): raise each frame part
	window as it's created/reconfigured

1999-09-26  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	GraphicsExpose events

	* sawmill-ui.jl (build-file): new widget `file-name' for
	selecting files

	* frames.c, windows.c (list_frame_generator,
	install_window_frame): client window is always left beneath any
	overlapping frame parts

	* frames.c (set_frame_part_fg, list_frame_generator): the
	`foreground' frame part property may now be an image (or list
	of images), it's drawn into the part, respecting any defined
	justification, but with no scaling or tiling

1999-09-24  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* frames.c (set_frame_part_bg): when a shaped image is placed
	(at all) inside the client window, apply the shape mask to the
	frame part's window, not to the frame's window [this may
	conflict with shaped client windows?]

	* images.c (Ftile-image): fix bug when src image is vertically
	smaller than dest image

	* events.c (configure_request): when a client asks to be moved,
	factor in the frame offset if it's reparented

1999-09-23  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* keys.c (translate_event): fix bug where X server reports that
	it has a keysym at index 1 as well at index 0, even when
	xmodmap disagrees, and the keysyms are the same (XKB extension
	on XFree86)

	* sawmill-ui.jl (build-keymap): fix cancel/revert problem

	* sawmill-ui.jl (build-keymap): new button: copy

	* sawmill-ui.jl: improved the bindings widget, try to remove
	the annoying jitter when selected list items

	* session.c (Fsm_connect, Fsm_disconnect): new functions.
	Connection with the session manager is now removed from the
	actual initialisation process. The lisp code will call
	sm-connect at the right time

1999-09-21  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* colors.c (Fget_color): allocate all colors using
	Imlib_best_color_match (); this makes no difference using
	TrueColor or DirectColor visuals but should help on PseudoColor
	(i.e. 8 bit) visuals
	* sawmill.h (Lisp_Color): removed the XColor struct, just
	inline the three rgb values and the pixel color

	* main.c (main): call images_init () before colors_init (),
	since colors.c using Imlib

	* images.c, gradient.c, functions.c, frames.c: changes for new
	color type

	* frames.c (list_frame_generator): fix seg fault where either
	Fget_font () or Fget_color () returns an error

1999-09-20  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* keys.c (event_proxy_fun): deleted
	(lookup_event_binding): new function, used by eval_input_event
	and Flookup_event_binding, it finds the window to search in,
	then calls lookup_binding

1999-09-19  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* version 0.7

1999-09-18  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* keys.c (find_meta): if alt_mod is unset, set it to meta_mod
	(i.e. similarly to for meta_mod)
	(Qalt_keysyms, Qmeta_keysyms): variables showing which keysyms
	generate the two virtual modifiers

1999-09-17  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* frames.c (list_frame_generator): try to prevent weird shaped
	frames being created for very small client windows. The rule is
	that if a frame part's position is specified by a single edge,
	and it overlaps the opposite edge of the client window, then
	truncate the part to that edge. This still isn't perfect, but
	at least the border is always correct

1999-09-16  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* keys.c: added Mod5 to list of accepted modifiers

	* events.c (key_press): evaluate KeyRelease events again

	* functions.c (Fgrab_keyboard, Fungrab_keyboard): new functions

	* keys.h: EV_MOD_RELEASE extra modifier bit to mark KeyRelease
	events from KeyPress events
	* keys.c: removed the long methods of specifying modifiers
	(Veval_modifier_events, Veval_key_release_events): new 
	options, control whether we evaluate these abnormal events

	* functions.c (Fwarp_cursor_to_window): unless coordinates are
	given, warp relative to top-left corner of the frame. If coords
	are given, they are relative to the client window

	* functions.c (Fgrab_pointer): accept a nil window, and
	fallback to grabbing on the root if the specified window is
	unviewable

1999-09-15  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* frames.c (Qoverride_frame_part_classes): new variable,
	similar to Qframe_part_classes but with higher precedence than
	the frame definition itself

	* session.c, main.c, functions.c, frames.c, commands.c,
	alloca.c: try to support C_ALLOCA and other variants

	* windows.c (emit_pending_destroys): abort if a lisp interrupt
	occurs

	* frames.c (set_frame_part_bg): rearrange how shaped images are
	handled -- it's imperative that the frame must _always_ retain
	the union of the old and new shapes, unfortunately this means
	that we need to make a copy of the original frame shape..

1999-09-14  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* commands.c (Fcall_command): changed `f', `w' and `W'
	interactive codes to `%f', `%w' and `%W'. `%' is now reserved

	specified, but mod_any is set, then return AnyModifier and
	Button1 (which should be ignored)
	(grab_event, ungrab_event): support AnyModifier correctly

	* functions.c (Fdelete_window, Fdestroy_window): never use
	XKillClient, just XDestroyWindow

1999-09-12  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* version 0.6

	* windows.c (pending_destroys): new variable, the number of
	destroyed windows whose hooks haven't been called
	* windows.c, functions.c, events.c, display.c: call
	emit_pending_destroys () after round-trip X requests, try to
	minimize the time between a window dieing and its
	destroy-notify-hook being called

1999-09-11  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* cursors.c (Fcursorp): new function

	* windows.c (set_window_shape): if updating a shaped window
	with no frame, just use a single ShapeSet operation, not a
	ShapeSet followed by a ShapeUnion (fixes the flashing gmc icons
	bug)

1999-09-10  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* images.c (Fimagep): new function
	(bevel_pixel): increase the bevel multiplier from 0.5 to 0.75

	* windows.c (window_mark_type): ensure that closed windows

	* events.c (key_press): don't look for a frame part keymap
	(button_press, motion_notify): call get_keymap_for_frame_part

1999-09-09  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* keys.c, keys.h: added `click3' event

	* frames.c (frame_part_destroyer): if any of the frame parts
	are clicked, make sure that clicked_frame_part gets cleared

	* frames.c, windows.c: added a new window property
	`hide-client', when non-nil the client window won't be visible
	(call rebuild-frame after setting for it to take effect)

	* keys.c: removed hashed keymaps (vectors), just lists of
	bindings now
	(Fbind_key, Funbind_key): bindings no longer nest

	* sawmill-ui.jl (build-number-entry): use spin-buttons for
	entering numbers

	* events.c (property_notify): fixed this function

1999-09-08  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* sawmill.h (Lisp_Window): store window and icon names as lisp
	strings
	* events.c, windows.c: handle lisp string names, fix some
	memory leaks

	* sawmill-ui.jl: added --socket-id option to allow the ui to be
	embedded in the gnome control center. This also disables the
	ok/cancel/etc buttons and enables a hacky protocol on
	stdin/stdout

1999-09-07  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* frames.c (destroy_window_frame): new arg, whether or not to
	delete the top-level frame window or not
	(list_frame_generator): handle building a new frame into an old
	top-level window

	* windows.c (Fset_window_frame): don't delete the parent frame
	window, this prevents having to reparent the client back to the
	root, and in turn prevents all flickering

	* sawmill-ui.jl (ui-quit): tell the wm to save the custom file
	before exiting

	* images.c (Ftile_image): new function

	* sawmill-ui.jl: changed the architecture, instead of the wm
	connecting with the configurator, make the configurator connect
	with the wm (using sawmill-client); re-enabled the "revert"
	button

	* sawmill.h (Lisp_Window): added `destroyed' bit
	* windows.c (emit_pending_destroys): call destroy-notify-hook
	where it's required
	* events.c (destroy_notify): only call hook if it's not already
	been called
	(handle_input_mask): call emit_pending_destroys after each event
	* display.c (error_handler): mark that may be input pending on
	the X connection (so that the event loop will call
	emit_pending_destroys)

	* windows.c (install_window_frame, remove_window_frame): handle
	adding and deleting from the save-set here (so that unmapped
	but not destroyed windows are removed from it)

1999-09-06  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* sawmill-ui.jl (build-frame-style:update-readme): strip
	trailing whitespace from the README file

	* functions.c (Fshow_message): don't set save_under and
	backing_store in the message window--they slow down opaque
	window movement on XFree86..

	* windows.c, images.c, fonts.c, cursors.c, colors.c: define rep
	comparison functions for these types, I'd forgotten that they
	couldn't just be null pointers

	* display.c (error_handler): don't call destroy-notify-hook
	since it might generate X protocol requests (not allowed)

	* frames.c (Fframe_state_mutex): when this variable is non-nil,
	entering or leaving a frame-part's window won't affect its
	state. As a hack, if you set this to `clicked' the frame part's
	state will be set clicked (this is needed because LeaveNotify
	events seem to be able arrive before the MotionNotify events
	causing them)

	* events.c (enter_notify, leave_notify): don't change
	frame-part state if frame_state_mutex is set

	* keys.c (Fallow_events): new function, wrapper for
	XAllowEvents
	(grab_event): all active grabs now use GrabModeSync

	* events.c (button_press, key_press): call XAllowEvents
	with AsyncPointer or AsyncKeyboard after handling the event,
	since active grabs are now synchronous

	* events.c (focus_in): only handle the event if the window is visible

	* windows.c (find_window_by_id): print less debugging info

1999-09-05  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* functions.c (Fshow_message): new function, displays a
	specified string in the middle of the screen
	* events.c (expose): recognize when the message_win is exposed
	* main.c (main): call functions_kill

	* frames.c (frame_part_focuser): deleted since it's exactly the
	same as refresh_frame_parts ()

	* session.c (session_init): only try to connect if
	SESSION_MANAGER is set in the environment

1999-09-03  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* windows.c (add_window): only call place-window-hook if (as
	well as not being in initialisation) the `placed' property of
	the window isn't set
	(Fwindow_group_id): check that w->wmhints isn't a null pointer

	* session.c: the C portion of session management -- very minimal
	* sawmill.h (enum exit_codes): new member `ec_session_died'

	* main.c (Qsaved_command_line_args): new variable, contains the
	pristine command line arguments. Provides the arguments to
	exec() when restarting

	* functions.c (Fgetpid): new function, should be in librep,
	needed for session management

	* main.c (Qsaved_command_line_args): new variable, a list
	containing the unmodified args

1999-09-02  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* functions.c (Fx_raise_window): wrapper for XRaiseWindow ()

	* version 0.4

	* events.c (client_message): even if we can't find a client
	window object for the event, still pass it through the hook

	* gtk-style.c: helper program for `gtk' theme. Outputs the
	default GTK style as an s-expression

	* frames.c (refresh_frame_parts): new function

	* windows.c (Frebuild_frame): new function

	* images.c (Fclear_image): new function

1999-09-01  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* images.c (Fmake_sized_image): replaced the three pixel colors
	by one color object

	* frames.c: added a `render-scale' attribute, allows the buffer
	size of parts rendered on the fly to be reduced
	* sawmill.h (struct frame_part): added render_scale field

	* images.c (Fbevel_image): new function

1999-08-31  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* frames.c: new attribute in frame part alists: `renderer', a
	function called with args (IMAGE STATE). It should draw the
	background of the frame part into IMAGE for STATE (nil,
	focused, highlighted, clicked)

	* sawmill.h (struct frame_part): new fields `renderer',
	`rendered_image' and `rendered_state'

	* images.c (make_image): search the list of images before
	making a new lisp object
	(Fmake_sized_image): new function, create a blank image of a
	certain size and colour

	* gradient.c (Fdraw_vertical_gradient,
	Fdraw_horizontal_gradient, Fdraw_diagonal_gradient): new
	plugin, new functions

	* windows.c, main.c, keys.c, images.c, functions.c, frames.c,
	fonts.c, events.c, cursors.c, colors.c: added doc strings for
	built-in functions

	* display.c (sys_init): don't connect to display if batch-mode
	is non-nil
	* keys.c, images.c, frames.c, fonts.c, cursors.c, colors.c: if
	batch-mode is non-nil, don't do anything that would access the
	display when initialising or shutting down

	* windows.c (Fset_client_state): deleted

	* functions.c (Fget_x_property, Fset_x_property): use CARD16
	and CARD32 types to access 16- and 32-bit data respectively

	* keys.c (num_lock_mod): initialised to the Num_Lock modifier,
	ignored in events
	(grab_event, ungrab_event): grab all combinations including
	LockMask and num_lock_mod

	* keys.c (translate_event): ignore the Lock modifier

	* functions.c (Fgrab_pointer): pass last_event_time to
	XGrabPointer (), not CurrentTime (since Fungrab_pointer also
	passes last_event_time)

	* events.c (handle_input_mask): set last_event_time to
	CurrentTime on leaving the function

	* sawmill.h: defining DEBUG to zero sends debugging output to
	db_printf ()
	* display.c (db_printf): replacement printf to store debugging
	output in one of rep's debug buffers

	* sawmill-ui.jl (keymap-shell): doesn't choke on non-symbol
	commands anymore, but it's still not possible to edit arbitrary

	* events.c (button_press): click the frame before looking for
	the context map (since we only look for these maps in clicked
	frame parts)
	(unmap_notify): call reset_frame_parts

	* windows.c (Fhide_window): call reset_frame_parts

	* frames.c (reset_frame_parts): new function, resets clicked or
	highlighted state associated with a window frame

1999-08-29  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* sawmill-ui.jl: fix option-menu problems, abbreviate displayed
	font names to just the font's family

	* sawmill.h: define _GNU_SOURCE
	* functions.c, client.c: some minor `-ansi -pedantic' fixes

1999-08-27  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* events.c (colormap_notify): fix bug where changing a colormap
	when no window is focused causes a segfault

	* sawmill.h (XlibSpecificationRelease): if undefined, define to
	4; this really means X11R4 or _less_

	* display.c (XGetAtomNames): implement using XGetAtomName ()
	for X11R5 or less

	* events.c (configure_request): if we know about the window,
	call raise-window or lower-window instead of XRaiseWindow () or
	XLowerWindow ()

	* sawmill-ui.jl (build-set): only call
	gtk-option-menu-set-history if history is non-nil

	* sawmill.h (struct frame_part): added `highlighted' and
	`pending_refresh' bits

	unclicking parts when the mouse leaves them. If the
	ButtonRelease occurs when the mouse isn't in the part, the
	context-map is ignored

	* frames.c: the background/foreground attributes are now
	(NORMAL FOCUSED HIGHLIGHTED CLICKED) (note addition of
	highlighted class, displayed when the mouse is in the part)
	(Vframe_draw_mutex): when t no frame parts are redrawn

	* events.c (Qproperty_notify_hook, Qreparent_notify_hook): new
	hooks
	(get_event_mask): new function, returns an event mask that
	would select a specified type of event

	* keys.c (Fproxy_current_event): allow event_mask and propagate
	args to XSendEvent to be specified

	* frames.c (refresh_frame_part): new function, draws both
	background and foreground

	* sawmill-ui.jl (build-set): sets can now be displayed as
	option menus, clists, as well as the old radio buttons,
	controlled by the ui-set-style var, or the :widget key

1999-08-25  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* display.c (beep): new function, hooked into rep_beep_fun

	XKillClient

	* windows.c (Fstacking_order): new function

	* functions.c (Fraise_window, Flower_window,
	Fraise_lower_window, Fcirculate_up, Fcirculate_down): deleted

	* events.c (key_press): ignore KeyRelease events

1999-08-23  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* frames.c (list_frame_generator): was making the rectangle of
	the client window too big when setting the shape mask

	* commands.c (Fcall_command): the `W' specifier ignores the
	current event's window if it's the root

	* client.c: new option `-c COMMAND' to invoke an interactive
	function

	* sawmill-ui.jl (build-pages): use a HPaned widget to contain
	the box and group frame, this stops the boundary changing to
	match their relative sizes

	* version 0.3a

	window to grab in
	(Fungrab_pointer): if we're waiting for a ButtonRelease on a

	(Fquery_pointer): optional arg GET, to force a round-trip to
	the server
	(Faccept_x_input): new function, process any available X events

	PropertyNotify event, not just for synchronous requests

1999-08-22  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* version 0.3

	* client.c: new client-server protocol, using X properties to
	allow inter-host communications
	* server.h, server.c: deleted, the server is now Lisp code

	* windows.c (x_find_window_by_id): try harder to find a window
	object for an id, possibly returning an invalidated object
	(remove_window): even if the window has been invalidated, try
	to remove the frame when appropriate

	* sawmill.h (Lisp_Window): new field `saved_id', this is
	another copy of the window id, but isn't zeroed when the error
	handler finds that the window has been deleted

	* events.c (property_notify): between XGet.. calls, check if
	the error handler invalidated the window

	* events.c (destroy_notify): use the x_find_window_by_id
	function to search for a window object for the destroyed window
	(since the error handler may have invalidated it)

	* keys.c: handle `Alt' similarly to `Meta' (i.e. find the
	actual modifier bit then subsitute it)
	* keys.h: added EV_MOD_ALT

	* events.c (Fquery_pointer): only use the stored mouse position
	if we're currently handling an event, and this event stored the
	position

	* functions.c (Fgrab_server, Fungrab_server): set
	`rep_message_fun' to null whilst the server is grabbed (in case
	stdout is to an xterm)

	* functions.c (Fgrab_pointer): if the specified window object
	doesn't have a mapped frame, then grab in the root window

	* functions.c (Fget_x_property): return nil if property doesn't
	exist

1999-08-21  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* functions.c (Fraise_window, Flower_window,
	Fraise_lower_window, Fdelete_window, Fdestroy_window): these
	now use the `W' interactive decl

	* keys.c (Fcurrent_event_window): check if the window is a
	frame part
	(lookup_binding): new arg, CURRENT-WINDOW, the window whose
	`keymap' property is to be scanned
	(eval_input_event): if the event is a pointer event, look for a
	binding in the window that received the event, not the window
	with the input focus

	* commands.c (Fcall_command): new interactive specs, `w', the
	window that received the current event, and `W', either the
	same as `w' or the focused window

	* main.c (Qbefore_exit_hook): new hook; called before exiting

	* keys.c (Fcurrent_event_window): as well as returning a window
	object, this might instead return the symbol `root' or the
	integer id of an unmanaged window
	(Fproxy_current_event): send the current event on to a
	specified window

	* gnome.c: deleted, this is now done in lisp

	* functions.c (Fdelete_window): accept integer window ids
	(Fdestroy_window): if an integer window id, use XDestroyWindow,
	not XKillClient
	(Fsend_client_message): new function
	(Fcreate_window): new function (so I can do gnome-wm in lisp)
	(x-atom, x-atom-name): translate between symbols<->atoms

	* events.c (client_message): now pass _all_ the data in the
	event to the hook, format is (WINDOW TYPE-ATOM DATA-ARRAY).
	DATA-ARRAY is a string (8-bit format) or vector of integers

	* display.c (x_atom_symbol, x_win_from_arg): new functions

1999-08-20  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* functions.c (Flist_x_properties, Fdelete_x_property,
	Fset_x_property, Fget_x_property): new functions

	* client.c (eval_lisp_form): don't use puts () to output the
	result string since it could contain zero bytes

	* windows.c (remove_window): a new argument FROM-ERROR. If
	non-nil then we're being called from the error handler, and
	thus won't generate any X protocol requests, let gc destroy the
	frame later

	* frames.c (frame_part_destroyer): don't try to delete parts
	without windows

1999-08-19  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* frames.c, events.c: it's possible for Imlib_render to trigger
	the X error handler, and possibly invalidate the window that's
	currently being manipulated. So test that `w->id != 0' in
	suitable places

1999-08-16  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* version 0.2

	* display.c (sys_init): create a new window `no_focus_window'
	that gets given the focus when no other window has it (so we
	receive KeyPress events from it)
	* windows.c (focus_on_window): when told to focus on nothing,
	focus on the `no_focus_window'
	* events.c (unmap_notify): if the window being unmapped has the
	focus (after calling the unmap-notify-hook), unfocus it

	* sawmill-ui.jl: two new elements `keymap' and `keymap-shell',
	for keymap customization

	* sawmill-ui.jl (build-color:clicked): hide the `Help' button
	in the color selection dialog (since it does nothing)

	* sawmill-ui.jl: always format color specifiers correctly

1999-08-13  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* sawmill-ui.jl (build-color): implements a separate `color'
	element (pretty similar to the `font' element)
	(build-pages): pages are now implemented as a clist and a frame
	(instead of a notebook). This can be changed via the
	ui-pages-style variable

	* frames.c (list_frame_generator): the `foreground',
	`background' and `font' keys may now be functions

	* frames.c (set_frame_part_bg): for shaped images, apply the
	mask at the correct frame coordinates

	* windows.c (Fwindow_transient_p): use the cached value

	* windows.c (focus_on_window): update `focus_window'
	immediately, instead of waiting for the FocusIn event
	* events.c, display.c: be more careful when changing the
	`focus_window' variable

	* events.c: record the time of the _two_ most recent pointer
	positions, the new function Fquery_last_pointer allows access
	to the earlier position

1999-08-11  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* sawmill-ui.jl: use a ButtonBox for the control buttons, don't
	display the Revert and Refresh buttons (but they're still
	there, just not enabled)

1999-08-10  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* sawmill-ui.jl, sawmill-menu.jl: copied from top-level
	directory, these are now compiled before being installed

	* events.c (handle_input_mask): new function, handle all
	outstanding events matching a specified event mask

	* windows.c (Fset_window_frame): between removing the old frame
	and installing the new frame handle all SubstructureNotify

1999-08-09  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* sawmill.h (Lisp_Window): make `reparenting' an int so it can

	existing cursor

	Fcall_window_hook instead of Fcall_hook

	* gnome.c (rep_dl_init): if ignored-window-names or

	setting window->id to zero
	(sys_init): select for SubstructureNotify on root window

	* windows.c (fix_window_size): call set_window_shape

	* windows.c (add_window): set frame_style to nil not
	default-frame initially

	* frames.c: remove the frame data type, now frames are just
	lists, a null list is a null frame. Also, a window's frame may
	be specified as a symbol, in this case the plist of the symbol
	is used for the frame properties

	* windows.c (install_window_frame): also select
	SubstructureRedirectMask for frame, so that we get
	ConfigureRequest events for the client window

1999-07-25  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* frames.c (list_frame_generator): add LeaveWindowMask to frame
	parts
