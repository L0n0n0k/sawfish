  + refresh groups after committing changes

    (since this may cause slots to be added)

  + method of autoloading group details when demanded

  + reversed dependences? i.e. `:depends (not foo)'

  + decide whether to use GNOME widgets or not

  + more widgets:

	(table ("NAME" ...) (WIDGET ...))	[doable]

	(progam-name)
	(directory-name),

  + support for loading groups on demand

    only fetch the current group's information
    (which may have been cached from the previous time)

    maybe use CORBA for wm communication instead of client program? (or
    perhaps support both somehow?)

    [done, apart from CORBA]

  + do i18n on choices from `:type symbol' options

  + add a `Program Launchers' group, that allows commands to be defined
    for launching programs

  + split theme menu by first letter, if many themes to show

  + another idea: textual search for options/commands

  + Allow text-entry commands in bindings dialog?

--

Items that have been committed:

  + more widgets:

	(alist ("KEY" WIDGET)
	       ("VALUE" WIDGET))

	(list "NAME" WIDGET)

	(file-name)

  + proper revert

  + choice of `apply/revert/cancel/ok', `revert/cancel/ok', or just `ok'

  + autoload widget definitions (e.g. if requesting widget type `foo'
    that is unavailable, look for a module nokogiri-widget-foo)

  + nautilus-like ``user levels'' controlling when options get enabled

  + rewrite sawmill-ui to use ``items'' as in sawmill-themer (complex
    widgets represented by functional data types). This would allow
    more complex custom types, i.e. `(or number string)' etc...

  + also, add provisions for extensibility (i.e. adding new item types
    at run-time)

  + also, add simple dependences (i.e. widgets can be activated by a
    separate boolean option)
