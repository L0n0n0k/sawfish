1999-08-01  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* workspace.jl (ws-remove-window): fix the bug whereby deleting
	the last workspace didn't nullify ws-current-workspace. Also
	ensure that both remove-from-workspace and
	delete-workspace-hook are only called _after_ the deletion has
	occurred. remove-from-workspace now gets two args: window and
	workspace

1999-07-31  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* workspace.jl: new hook `delete-workspace-hook'

	* transient.jl (ignored-window-names, sticky-window-names): new
	variables, lists of regexps

	* sawmill-defaults.jl: removed the user-add-window function,
	added some comments about getting GNOME support

	* place-window.jl (ignore-program-positions): program specified
	window positions are ignored if this is set. User specified
	positions are never ignored

	* keymaps.jl: bind the root menu to Button2 not Button1

1999-07-30  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* menus.jl (menu-program-stays-running): if this variable is a
	number, it defines how long (in seconds) that a menu subprocess
	is allowed to stay running between menus being required.
	Default is one minute

1999-07-29  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* simple.jl, brushed-metal.jl, absolute-e.jl: changes for
	framesets

	* transient.jl: introduce the frameset idea, an alist of frames

	* auto-raise.jl: new file, uses a timer to work correctly
	(raise-windows-on-focus): can now be a regexp matching window
	names to raise
	* focus.jl: removed the auto-raise stuff

1999-07-28  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* workspace.jl (next-workspace-window): new command

	* focus.jl (focus-raise): synchronise the server before timing
	out

1999-07-28  Stewart Perry  <scp@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* focus.jl (raise-windows-on-focus, raise-window-timeout): new
	variables, auto-raise functionality

1999-07-28  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* sawmill-defaults.jl: set the frame to `nil-frame' to turn off
	the frame, not to nil

	* transient.jl (transient-add-window): only set the frame if
	it's currently nil, set it to default-frame if not transient or
	shaped

	* simple.jl, brushed-metal.jl, absolute-e.jl: frames are
	defined as lists now

	* absolute-e.jl: added shaped and shaped-transient frames

	* transient.jl: now looks for shaped windows as well as
	transients

1999-07-26  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* workspace.jl (raise-window-on-uniconify): new variable

	* menus.jl (apps-menu): new variable, the "Applications" item
	of the root menu

1999-07-25  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* workspace.jl (cycle-through-workspaces,
	delete-workspaces-when-empty, uniconify-to-current-workspace,
	static-workspace-menus): new variables
	(workspace-menu, window-menu): dynamic menu constructors
	(iconify-window, uniconify-window): new commands

	* sawmill.jl: load some more libraries

	* place-window.jl: this uses the new place-window-hook. But
	random placement is still the only working option

	* move-resize.jl: now obeys most of the window's size hints
	(all but the aspect ratios)

	* menus.jl: implement popup menus using the sawmill-ui script

	* functions.jl (get-window-by-name, get-window-by-id): new
	functions

	* keymaps.jl: some more bindings
	(root-window-keymap): new keymap
