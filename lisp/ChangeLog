	* transient.jl (transient-unmap-window): if the window being
	unmapped is focused, and there's no transient-parent to focus

	* custom.jl, customize.jl: new custom properties `custom-set',
	`custom-get' and `custom-widget'; inherited from type if not

	``state'' (i.e. sticky, iconified, ..) changes

	* workspace.jl (toggle-window-sticky): new command
	(ws-remove-window): new optional argument DONT-HIDE

	workspace
