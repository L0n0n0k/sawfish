todo:

  ! resize is non-intuitive

  + handle window groups

  + better transient handling

    When moving a window to another workspace, also move any transients (?)

  + only random window placement currently works

  + pixmap cursors / cursor recolouring

  + icons (?)

  + more seamless ``theming''

    Possibly define a `load-theme' function and lay down some interface
    requirements..?

  + export more Imlib functions

    (the bevel function in Imlib 1.9.5+)

  + GNOME compliance

    Currently event proxying and the pager hints are implemented.
    Add support for the various window state operations.. (currently
    only the sticky attribute is supported)

  + support MWM hints

    I've partially done this, but it's totally untested (also goes for
    OpenLook hints)

  + GUI configuration

    Customization of key bindings is a bit simplistic -- whenever a
    single binding is changed, the whole keymap is then fixed in the
    user's .sawmill-custom file

  - Rewrite key-binding

    This was originally lifted from Jade, my text editor. But it
    doesn't really fit that well...

    Also, _key_ bindings in frame parts don't work (since they're not
    grabbed and the frame part is never actually focused)

  - session management
