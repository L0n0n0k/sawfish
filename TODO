todo:

  ! resize is non-intuitive

  + handle window groups

  + better transient handling

    When moving a window to another workspace, also move any transients (?)

  + only random window placement currently works

  + pixmap cursors / cursor recolouring

  + icons (?)

  + more seamless ``theming''

    Possibly define a `load-theme' function and lay down some interface
    requirements..?

  + export more Imlib functions

    (the bevel function in Imlib 1.9.5+)

  - GNOME compliance

    Currently event proxying and the pager hints are implemented.
    Add support for the various window state operations..

  - GUI configuration

    Use the sawmill-ui script. This could at least be used to set
    variables, and things like that..
