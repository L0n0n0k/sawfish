todo:

  ! resize is non-intuitive

  + better transient handling, transients-on-parents-workspace and
    transients-get-focus variables

  + only random window placement currently works

  + pixmap cursors / cursor recolouring

  + icons (?)

  + more seamless ``theming''

    Possibly define a `load-theme' function and lay down some interface
    requirements..?

  + export more Imlib functions

    (colour modifiers, the bevel function in Imlib 1.9.5+)

  - GNOME compliance

    At least for the workspaces (so the pager works), and the pointer
    event forwarding

  - GUI configuration

    Use the sawmill-ui script. This could at least be used to set
    variables, and things like that..
