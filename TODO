todo:

  ! fix resize

  ! fix workspace problems (all done now?)

  ! fg of frame part is lost when clicking and moving

  + window placement

  + regrab keys when keymaps change

  + pixmap cursors / cursor recolouring

  + icons (?)

  + more seamless ``theming''

    Possibly define a `load-theme' function and lay down some interface
    requirements..?

  + export more Imlib functions

    (colour modifiers, the bevel function in Imlib 1.9.5+)

  - GNOME compliance

    At least for the workspaces (so the pager works), and the pointer
    event forwarding
