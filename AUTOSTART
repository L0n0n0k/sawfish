Additional Notes on sawfish.wm.prg.*
====================================

All modules in sawfish.wm.prg. are 'required by default.

=== Trayer ===

This modules allows you to control a trayer instance per-session.

Due to high amount of options trayer has, we don't provide an option
to 'just start' trayer with Sawfish.

To enable autostarting trayer with vendor defaults, use this in sawfishrc:

(start-trayer)

(start-trayer) supports all commandline-settings of trayer, so you could use:

(start-trayer #:expand "true" #:edge "bottom" #:align "center" #:width 500)

As you can see, booleans need to passed as strings ("true"/"false").

see sawfish.wm.prg.trayer for all #: keys and default values.

=== xgamma ===

This module allows you to control your monitor's gamma settings. Configuration
can be done via SawfishConfig => Misc =>â€ƒExternal Applications. You can modify
the RGB channels separately. Changes will take effect immediately and on next
start if you choose to do so.

=== xmobar ===

This module allows you to control a xmobar instance per-session.

In SawfishConfig => Misc => External Applications you can choose whether to
auto-start xmobar with Sawfish and what configuration file to load. By default
that is $HOME/.xmobarrc.

=== xmodmap ===

This module allows you to load a keymap using xmodmap. By default $HOME/.Xmodmap
is used. In SawfishConfig => Misc => External Applications you can choose whether
to start xmodmap on Sawfish start and what configuration file to load.

Before the file is loaded, sawfish saves the default keymap. Before restarting
Sawfish the restored keymap is loaded (and after restart the modifed re-loaded.

This ensures you can always use (restore-keymap) in order to (pseudo)undo the
changes to your keymap done by xmodmap. Useful when playing around with xmodmap.

=== xsettingsd ===

xsettingsd is a daemon that implements the XSettings protocoll and as such it allows
GTK+ (or any other compliant toolkit) to get it's settings like theme, icon-theme,
cursor-theme or font from it.

To get your current configuration you can do this:

run `gnome-settings-daemon' and then `sawfish-client -f dump-xsettings'

this will convert GSD settings to XSD settings. Be aware: if you use GSD from GNOME3,
the Net/Theme property will contain a GTK+3 theme.

So check this value in $HOME/.xsettingsd first and change it to a valid GTK+2 theme.
Alternatively you can grab and modify the file XSettings shipped in our source-directory.

In SawfishConfig => Misc => External Applications you can choose whether to auto-start
xsettingsd and what configuration file to use, by default $HOME/.xsettingsd
